*(Last updated: October 26, 2025)*

Gravity leap we operates the Inner Glow mobile application (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection and use of information when you use our Service.

**Please note that Inner Glow is designed to provide its functionalities WITHOUT directly collecting Personal Data (information that can identify you personally).**

However, as described below, non-personal information and device identifiers are collected by integrated third-party services for advertising operations and application analytics.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**We do NOT collect any Personal Data (information that can identify you personally) directly from you.** You are not required to create an account, provide your name, email address, or any other information that could directly identify you to use Inner Glow.

### Types of Data Collected (via Third-Party Services)

Our application integrates third-party services that may collect certain types of data, as detailed below. This data is used to provide advertisements, improve the application and its performance, and does not allow us to directly identify you as an individual.

* **Device Identifiers:** Unique identifiers associated with your mobile device (such as your device's advertising ID - ADID on Android, IDFA on iOS). These identifiers may be used by advertising and analytics services to distinguish devices and deliver personalized advertisements.
* **Application Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the application and displayed advertisements. This includes data such as frequency of use, features viewed, interactions with ads (clicks, impressions), and application performance information. This data is aggregated and not linked to your personal identity.
* **Diagnostic and Performance Data:** Information about crashes, responsiveness, and other technical data related to the application's performance.
* **Approximate Location:** Third-party services may infer an approximate geographic location (e.g., country or region) from your device's IP address. This information is used for ad relevance and aggregated analytics, and is not used to track your exact location.

---

## 2. Use of Collected Data

The anonymized data and device identifiers collected via third-party services are used for the following purposes:

* **To Provide and Maintain the Service:** Ensure the proper functioning of the application.
* **To Display Advertisements:** To fund the Service by displaying relevant ads via Google AdMob.
* **To Improve the Service:** Understand how the application is used to identify areas for improvement and fix bugs.
* **To Monitor Service Usage:** Track overall usage trends and performance.
* **To Detect and Prevent Technical Issues:** Ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
* **To Process In-App Subscriptions:** Manage subscription purchases through payment platforms.

## 3. Transfer of Data

Your information (primarily device identifiers and anonymized usage data) may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.

By using the Service, you consent to this transfer.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of personally identifiable data is performed by us.

## 4. Disclosure of Data

We may disclose anonymized data or device identifiers to third-party service providers, as described below.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose information (non-PII) in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

* Comply with a legal obligation.
* Protect and defend our rights or property.
* Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.
* Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.
* Protect against legal liability.

## 5. Security of Data

The security of your data is important to us. While we do not collect Personal Data, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect the data we collect via third parties. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

---

## 6. Third-Party Service Providers (Advertising and Analytics)

We employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), including providing advertising and analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to data (primarily device identifiers and non-personal usage data) only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

* **Advertising (Google AdMob):**
    We use Google AdMob, a mobile advertising service provided by Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), to display advertisements within our application. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad personalization and measurement of ad effectiveness. This information is collected and processed in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy. To learn more about how Google uses data for advertising, please visit: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
    We do not have direct control over the specific data collected by Google AdMob or how Google uses this data for its own purposes, beyond what is permitted by their policies and your device's privacy settings.

* **Usage Analytics (Google Analytics for Firebase):**
    We use Google Analytics for Firebase, an analytics service provided by Google Inc., to collect **anonymized and aggregated** usage data to understand application performance and user behavior, without collecting personally identifiable data. For more information on Firebase's privacy policy, please visit: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)

* **In-App Purchases (Apple App Store / Google Play Store):**
    We offer subscriptions through Apple and Google's in-app purchase platforms. We do not store your payment information. This information is processed directly by the third-party payment platforms (Apple App Store and Google Play Store), whose use of your information is governed by their respective privacy policies:
    * Google Play In-App Payments: [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
    * Apple App Store In-App Payments: [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-media-services/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-media-services/)

## 7. Links To Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third-party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## 8. Children's Privacy

**Our Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 13 ("Children") and does not knowingly target them.**

Since we do not have a registration mechanism or direct collection of Personal Data, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. However, advertising served via Google AdMob may collect device identifiers, which could be considered personal data.

If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information (e.g., if you believe device identifiers linked to your child have been inappropriately collected via AdMob without your verifiable parental consent), please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected data from children under 13 in a non-compliant manner, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers promptly.

**If you are under 13, please do not use this Service or provide any information through its features without the supervision of a parent or guardian.**

## 9. Your Controls and Right to Data Deletion

Since Inner Glow does not directly collect any personally identifiable data from you, we do not offer an internal in-app mechanism to request the deletion of "your" account or "your" personal data directly, as such data is not stored by us.

However, you have significant controls regarding the data collected by third-party services:

* **Managing Advertising Identifiers:** Advertising services like Google AdMob use a unique advertising identifier associated with your device (ADID on Android, IDFA on iOS). You can **reset this identifier** at any time through your mobile device's privacy settings. Resetting your advertising identifier may affect ad personalization. You can also enable "Limit Ad Tracking" or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" in your device settings.
    * For Android: Settings > Google > Ads
    * For iOS: Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking (to disable tracking) or Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising (to reset Identifier or turn off Personalized Ads).

* **Opting Out of Personalized Ads:** You can typically opt out of personalized advertising from Google and other ad networks by visiting [https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/) and [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).
* **Deleting the App:** If you wish to cease all data collection related to your usage of Inner Glow, you can simply delete the application from your device. This will remove the app's access to your device and stop any further data collection by the integrated third-party services on that device for Inner Glow.
* **Exercising Rights with Third-Party Providers:** For any data collected by third-party services (like Google AdMob or Firebase), you would need to exercise your data rights (e.g., access, deletion requests) directly with those third-party providers, subject to their respective privacy policies and legal obligations.
